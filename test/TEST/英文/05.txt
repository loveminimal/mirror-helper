모모If you're finding it tough to land a job밃try expanding your job밄hunting plan to include the following tactics밐

모모Set your target.While you should always keep your options open to compromise밃you should also be sure to target exactly what you want in a job.A specific job hunt will be more efficient than a haphazard one.

모모Schedule ample interviews.Use every possible method to get interviews몱몱answering ads밃using search firms밃contacting companies directly밃surfing the Web밃and networking.Even if a job is not perfect for you밃every interview can be approached as a positive experience.

모모Follow up.Even if someone does not hire you밃write them a thank밄you note for the interview.Then밃some weeks later밃send another brief letter to explain that you still have not found the perfect position and that you will be available to interview again if the original position you applied for몱몱or any other position밃for that matter몱몱is open.Do this with every position you interview for밃and you may just catch a break.
