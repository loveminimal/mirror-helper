We often close ourselves off when traumatic events happen in our lives; instead of letting the world soften us, we let it drive us deeper into ourselves. We try to deflect the hurt and pain by pretending it doesn't exist, but although we can try this all we want, in the end, we can't hide from ourselves. We need to learn to open our hearts to the potentials of life and let the world soften us.
