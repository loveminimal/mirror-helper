In the medieval mind, Yarmouth was associated with herring, a high-protein food important to the diet of the lower classes, which featured less meat than is eaten today. The thirteenth century seal of the borough bore depictions of a ship sailing herring-inhabited waters and, on the other side, St. Nicholas, a patron saint of fishermen. The fishery provided the reason for Yarmouth's foundation and the principal source of its medieval economy. Great Yarmouth -- the qualifier distinguishing it from its southern neighbour, Little Yarmouth -- is situated near where several rivers, among them the Yare, flow into what was once a very broad estuary opening out into the sea. In Roman times there was a port and market town a little further north, at Caistor, and a small fort at Burgh Castle; these were later abandoned. Subsequent settlement focused on the site of Great Yarmouth itself. Tradition has the first settlement there established by the Saxon leader, Cerdic, ca. 495, but this is unsubstantiated and doubtful. More certain is that silting in the mouth of the "Great Estuary" over time formed a huge sandbank that came to be several miles long, leaving the Yare access into the sea through two channels at either end of the sandbank; one channel separated Yarmouth and Caister, the other ran southwards for some miles and separated Great and Little Yarmouth/Gorleston before entering the sea. This sandbank eventually became firm enough to support dwellings, perhaps preceded by more temporary facilities for the drying, salting and smoking of herring, as well as the sale of herring. Fishermen from the Cinque Ports claimed a long-standing right to beach their boats and to dry their nets there.
