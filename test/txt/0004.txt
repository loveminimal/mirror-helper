The Fifth Shanghai International Film Festival was not only a feast for movie-goers but also turned out to be a huge gathering for Chinese movie enthusiasts to talk about the Chinese film business. The nine-day film festival, which ended on Sunday, drew many domestic and international filmmakers, stars and critics. An audience of 17,000 flocked daily to cinemas in China's most international metropolis. At discussion in and outside cinemas, critics and audience blame an increasing competitive entertainment market, poor production quality and monopolized distribution channels for losing appeal of most Chinese films. The Chinese film industry enjoyed its best days during the past few decades but has suffered hugely in recent years. Today, people enjoy much more freedom in choosing the way they spend their leisure time. Films are no longer the major pastime for Chinese people to kill their time. But rather, it is TV programmes that dominate their leisure hours. No wonder that movie audiences have been shrinking; box office revenues, especially those of home-grown low budget films, have gone down in recent years. Bad film quality, unsatisfactory services in movie theatres and rampant film piracy on Video Compact Disc and Digital Video Disc also keep people from going to the cinema.Some think the biggest problem of the Chinese film industry is not competition from other forms of entertainment or overseas box office hits but their poor quality due to various reasons.
